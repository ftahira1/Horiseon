##Installation
First create a new repository in Github by going to Settings->Repositories->New->Choose a name, make it public and choose a license.
Next, copy this repository to your local computer by opening the github and copying your repository link and then going to terminal and making sure you're at the desired folder to add it. At the terminal use these commands: git status->git clone "repository link".
Next go to my github and download the zip folder and by using GUI or your cursor you can add them in the folder you created.
